    "fillna(): This function is used to fill missing (NaN) values in the DataFrame with a specified value or a method such as forward fill or backward fill. It helps in handling missing data and ensuring the completeness of the dataset.\n",

For example, you can update the values of a Series using indexing or assignment (series[index] = value).\n",

However, Panels are not mutable; once created, their structure and contents cannot be modified. Panels were deprecated in Pandas version 0.25.0 and are no longer recommended for use. Instead, you can use multi-index DataFrames or other data structures to represent multidimensional data."
